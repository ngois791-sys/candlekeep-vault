Lichen liches are undead remnants of powerful druids.

A lichen lich looks like a skeleton covered with fungi and bark-like lichen. A lichen lich has vines within its chest cavity. These vines exude viscid and poisonous black fluid.

      \ grove, creating a shambling mound. The shambling mound appears in an unoccupied\
      \ space within 30 feet of the lich, acts on its own initiative count, and obeys\
      \ the lich's commands. The shambling mound dies after 1 hour or when the lich\
      \ uses this lair action again.  \n- Rotten roots and vines magically erupt in\
      \ a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the lich can see within\
      \ 120 feet of it. The lich is unaffected by the roots and vines. For all other\

      \ within its reach, doing so with a successful DC 19 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
