# [Sapphire Sentinel](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/sapphire-sentinel-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 201*  

Stone golems are magical constructs cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Like other golems, they are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. The golem remains a noncombatant unless it is directly attacked.

## The Sapphire

The sapphire is inside the golem's chest, hidden behind an 9-inch-diameter stone disk. The outer surface of the disk is inscribed with a blue circle that has eight golden beams radiating from it like the rays of the sun.

The disk can be removed to reveal the glowing sapphire only when the golem receives a command to use its power from someone whose commands it obeys. Otherwise, the sapphire remains hidden. The gemstone is 6 inches in diameter and has the following properties:

- It is indestructible until the golem completes its mission.  
- The sapphire has 3 charges. As an action, the golem can expend 1 charge to cast [dispel magic](Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md) (as a 9th-level spell) from the sapphire using Constitution as its spellcasting ability. The sapphire ceases to glow if all its charges are expended, but it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn and glows again once it has 1 or more charges.  
- The golem attacks anyone who tries to remove the sapphire, which is worth 25,000 gp.
