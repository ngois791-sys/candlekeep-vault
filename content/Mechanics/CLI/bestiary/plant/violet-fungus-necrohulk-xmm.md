# [Violet Fungus Necrohulk](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\plant/violet-fungus-necrohulk-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 126*  

A violet fungus necrohulk forms when a violet fungus colony infests and animates an ample heap of decay. This necrohulk attacks prey and spreads fungal spores for the colony.

## Fungi

*Deadly Spores and Predatory Polyps*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

The dank, sunless Underdark is a fertile breeding ground for weird and dangerous fungi.
