## Pseudodragon

*Fickle, Pint-Sized Dragon*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Desert, Forest, Hill, Mountain, Urban  
- **Treasure.** [Arcana](Mechanics/CLI/tables/random-magic-items-arcana.md)  

Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely.

Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.

Many magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures' intellect and resistance to magic make them excellent companions, and they're considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles.

Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don't properly pamper their pseudo dragon familiars might be abandoned without warning. Roll on or choose an option from the Pseudo dragon Treats table to inspire a pseudodragon's taste in gifts.
