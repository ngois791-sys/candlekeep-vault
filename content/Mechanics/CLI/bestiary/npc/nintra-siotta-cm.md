# [Nintra Siotta](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/nintra-siotta-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 197*  

Nintra Siotta, a chaotic evil archfey who was exiled from the Gloaming Court by the Queen of Air and Darkness long ago, is known in Faerûn by three titles: Princess of the Shadow Glass, Lady of Dread Omens, and Seeker of the Three Crowns. She appears as a 9-foot-tall humanoid made of smoky gray glass, wrapped in a cloak-like darkness that appears to devour the light.

Nintra's eyes burn with green fire, and she speaks in a high, musical voice. Deception comes naturally to her, but imprisonment in *The Scrivener's Tale*has made her impatient and prone to telepathic outbursts that betray her cruel nature.
