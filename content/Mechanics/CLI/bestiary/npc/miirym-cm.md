# [Miirym](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/miirym-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 16*  

Well over 1,500 years ago, the silver dragon Miirym broke into Candlekeep, intent on adding its riches to her hoard. She devoured scholars and destroyed a score of irreplaceable books before she was confronted by an archmage and bound into service to protect Candlekeep as penance for her misdeeds. The wizard passed away before Miirym's sentence had been served, and other spellcasters were unable to break the enchantment that bound her.

Time passed and so did Miirym, whose corpse has long since crumbled into dust. Unfortunately for Miirym, the enchantment remains in effect on her spirit. The spectral dragon—what's left of her—dwells in the catacombs and caves under the library. Those who have visited the depths describe Miirym as a set of immense spectral jaws whose essence roils with the promise of breath weapons and spells of destruction.

Adventurers who explore the passages beneath Candlekeep might encounter Miirym, who's more interested in news of present-day Faerûn than in fighting. Indeed, Miirym is an engaging conversationalist if one has the inclination to chat with her.

Miirym doesn't have a treasure hoard. Instead, she protects the books and scrolls kept in her subterranean domain. The Sentinel Wyrm can be summoned by the Keeper of Tomes and called upon to defend Candlekeep from invaders who would plunder or destroy it. In her role as Candlekeep's defender, Miirym can move anywhere within the library fortress, passing through walls and other solid barriers. She can't enter extradimensional spaces, since they are not on the same plane of existence as Candlekeep.
