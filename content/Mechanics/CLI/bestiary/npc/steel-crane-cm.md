# [Steel Crane](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/steel-crane-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 164*  

Steel Crane is tall and slender. He is exceptionally handsome, with neat silver hair and deep green eyes, and carries himself with the grace of a dancer.

A strip of cloth was torn from the left sleeve of Steel Crane's white robe during the raid on Candlekeep, and Steel Crane hasn't yet bothered to mend the garment. The robe's damage is clearly visible—evidence of Steel Crane's role in the theft.
