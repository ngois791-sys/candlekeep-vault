# [Varnyr](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/varnyr-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 63*  

Varnyr is a senior scribe who has spent centuries at Candlekeep. She loves the books, which she cares for as though they were her grandchildren. She has little ambition to rise in the ranks of the Avowed, perfectly content as a senior scribe. She is hardworking and expects others to be as well.
