# [Jade Tigress](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/jade-tigress-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 166*  

Jade Tigress is a powerfully built woman whose body has been honed by intense physical training. She is rugged in appearance, with jet-black hair, hazel eyes, and a long, thin scar running across her right cheek. She matches the description of one of the thieves who infiltrated Candlekeep.
