# [Bak Mei](Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/bak-mei-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 168*  

Bak Mei was once an agile and skilled Shou monk famous for upholding justice and helping the needy in his distant homeland to the east of Faerûn. As he grew older, learned more about the world, and began to feel the weight of old age, his worldview changed dramatically. Motivated by his growing fear of death, Bak Mei became obsessed with living an unending life. He began collecting texts on the subject, consulting with practitioners of the necromantic arts, and seeking audiences with dark forces.

The abbots of his temple confronted Bak Mei about his radical pursuits and demanded that he cease his activities. In response, he tried to stage a revolt at the temple, a traitorous action that resulted in the excommunication of Bak Mei and his followers, who christened themselves the Order of the Immortal Lotus. The small group eventually settled in the forest near Baldur's Gate, where they recruit new members. Under Bak Mei's cruel tutelage and eccentric training methods, the order has grown in power and numbers, living in seclusion while he planned his revenge on his former superiors.

Bak Mei is notorious among the monks of Faerûn. Some see him as a vagabond, exiled from his order for traitorous acts and disregard for tradition. Others see him as a radical seeker of knowledge.

Bak Mei is an old man with a long white beard and bushy eyebrows. Like the other members of his order, Bak Mei is clad in snow-white robes secured by a black sash over a form-fitting black shirt and trousers.
