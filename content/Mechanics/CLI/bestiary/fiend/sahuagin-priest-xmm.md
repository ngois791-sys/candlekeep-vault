*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 265*  

Sahuagin priests serve the will of Sekolah or other fiendish masters. They direct and support other sahuagin, and they consider every combatant that falls in battle—whether enemy or ally—a sacrifice to their fierce deities.

## Sahuagin

*Ravagers from Beneath the Waves*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Underwater  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Sahuagin are fiendish terrors that prey on creatures above and below the water. Called "sea devils" by residents of coastal communities, sahuagin are ruthless raiders. They ransack ships, fishing villages, and undersea communities to slake their bloodthirst, claim treasure, and make sacrifices to their vicious deity—the sharklike god Sekolah.

Sahuagin constantly war on any peoples living near their territory. Merfolk and other aquatic folk bear the brunt of these attacks, but sahuagin also hunt air-breathers who sail over or swim through the waters the sea devils claim. Sahuagin often attack alongside sharks, which they can telepathically command.

> When a sahuagin comes at you, it doesn't seem to be living until it bites you. Then the thing's black eyes turn red as hellfire and the waves foam crimson. Then comes the screaming.
